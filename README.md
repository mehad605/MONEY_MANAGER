**Money Manager** is an Android application built with Flutter that helps users track their daily income and expenses.  
The app provides clear financial insights through charts and summaries, making it easy to identify spending patterns, highlight high-expense days, and plan finances effectively.  
By categorizing both income and expenses, it allows users to see which areas contribute the most income and which ones consume the most resources.

- A summary card showing **total balance**, **income**, and **expenses** for the selected month.  
- A line chart visualizing expenses over time (once data spans at least two dates).  
- Transaction lists available in detail or grouped by category.  

### Adding Transactions
- Tap the floating action button to add a transaction.  
- Enter amount, description, date, and select category (income or expense with subcategories).
